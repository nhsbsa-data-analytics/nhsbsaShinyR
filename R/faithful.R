#' A closer look at \code{faithful$eruptions} reveals that these are
#' heavily rounded times originally in seconds, where multiples of 5 are
#' more frequent than expected under non-human measurement.  For a
#' better version of the eruption times, see the example below.
#' There are many versions of this dataset around: Azzalini and Bowman
#' (1990) use a more complete version.
